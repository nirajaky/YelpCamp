# YelpCamp
YelpCamp is a Web Application where a user can upload his camping pictures with detail of camping place and also finds different camping region uploded by others.In this project I have used Node.js , Express and MongoDB database. Also, in frontend I have used some Bootstrap for better UI.
          I have done this project with the help my tutor Colt Steele, who teaches on Udemy Platform.
